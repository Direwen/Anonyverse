/* Extra Small Screens (Mobile):

For extra small screens, you can start with text-base (around 16px) for body text.
Use smaller classes like text-sm or text-xs for smaller text elements or fine print.
Consider using responsive classes to decrease font sizes further for very small screens if needed.
Small to Medium Screens (Tablets and Small Laptops):

Continue using text-base for body text as it's a good default size.
Use larger classes like text-lg or text-xl for headings and important elements to improve readability.
You can adjust font sizes based on the content and design.
Large Screens (Desktops and Large Monitors):

On large screens, you might use larger font sizes like text-xl or text-2xl for body text.
Headings can be even larger, such as text-3xl or text-4xl, to create visual hierarchy.
Adjust font sizes to make the most of the available screen space while maintaining readability.
Extra Large Screens (Large Monitors and Beyond):

For very large screens, you can further increase font sizes, but be mindful of line length and readability.
Test and adjust font sizes to ensure that text remains readable without becoming too large or overwhelming */
